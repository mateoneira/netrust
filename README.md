# Netrust

Netrust is a Rust crate for working with graphs. It provides a basic graph structure and a set of graph algorithms that operate on this structure.

## Features

- Basic graph structure: Netrust provides a simple and efficient graph data structure that allows you to represent and manipulate graphs.
- Graph algorithms: Netrust includes a collection of common graph algorithms, such as breadth-first search, depth-first search, and shortest path algorithms.

## Getting Started

To use Netrust in your Rust project, add the following line to your `Cargo.toml` file:
